## **Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:**

- What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?

    understand and practice authentication/authorization, nested resources; more MVC practice

- What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?

    Mary prefers pairs but wants a remote job; Anten likes pairing but fine with divide-and-conquer; Mary B is working on how to exist in paired project; Michael prefers divide-and-conquer; two is a good pair

- How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?

    Mary G prefers direct communication; Mary B echoes this; Making sure everyone's voice is heard and has equal input.

- How would you describe your work style?

    Mary B just wants to practice and views the project as a way to learn but not focus on the endpoint; Mary G enjoys finishing projects but understands there are realistic expectations and people can get to the point where they aren't learning anymore and being aware of that is key to success.

- What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
    - Mary B - TDD, enjoys front end
    - Mary G - TDD; heroku deployment; MVC general layout; weak - front end
    - Anten - weak - design
    - Michael - design; weak - activerecord
- Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
    - Mary B - need to be able to do things independently and that can sometimes cause issues
    - Mary G - good DTR resolves many initial communication issues; poor - when people don't have good DTR's or TDD
    - Anten - not going back over the user stories to make sure they are complete
    - Michael - poor - when people feel that their voice isn't heard
- How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
    - Mary B - making sure we organize our backend first
    - Mary G - talk about the direction before people start coding - arrange user stories to gain a broad idea; agreed upon path
    - Anten - paying attention to how much time we spend on front end
    - Michael - agreeing on design implementations before implementation
- How will we overcome obstacles?
    - Mary G - technical - talk to each other and don't be afraid to ask for help; communication - slack and work through
- Coding preferences
    - TDD, shorthand and clean DRY code when possible
- What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
    - Mary G - high focus on TDD; genuine feedback, non condescending help when I ask for it
